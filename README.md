# Catalog Search
> This project was created for the purpose of traversing a large video catalog on Vimeo, via a CSV, and providing a way to autosuggest titles based on input. At the same time this serves as a basic example of how to use React paired with Go as a back-end technology. Most of the project is adapted from 'go-starter-kit' by olebedev and then injected with react-autosuggest. The instructions below are from the 'go-starter-kit' README which can also be found in the file 'go-starter-kit-README.md'.
